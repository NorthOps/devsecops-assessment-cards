1,Operability,Config deployment,How easy is to deploy/inject a configuration change,We can run the majority of config changes independantly of our code release.  All changes are auditable and revertable,We have to manual changes,,1
2,Observability,Hardware insights,How much insight do we have into the behaviour of our infra/deployment fabric,"We can tell you the CPU, RAM, Network & DiskIO for all our hardware in granular detail.  We can enumerate our hardware in detail and know which OS/CPU etc weâ€™re running on",We only have very rough measures of our hardware performance,,1
3,Testability,Feature Coverage,What proportion of the features are covered by a test,Every one of our features has at least one test,Less than 25% of our features have corresponding tests,,1
4,CI/CD,CI/CD Speed and Stability,CI/CD processes are fast and stable,The CI/CD pipelines are super fast and we get feedback on our software on almost real-time basis,CI/CD takes so long to do or is very fragile and we end up losing whole chunks of our day to it.,,1
5,Availability,MTTR,How long does it take you to restore service in the case of an incident,We track our MTTR across the board and can restore in <10 mins on average,We do not track this properly,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_time_to_repair,1
6,Culture,Easy to Release,How easy is it to release the software that you work to production,It's easy and straightforward to release my changes,It's very difficult to release and takes a long time,,2
7,Culture,Low friction processes,Do you feel that the processes are suitable for you to deliver software cotinuously,"The whole thing is a well oiled machine, everybody is in their groove and we barely feel any friction. The processes help us to do the right thing","The processes are painful, too numerous and makes us cry",,1
