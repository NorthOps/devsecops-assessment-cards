1,Operability,Config deployment,How easy is to deploy/inject a configuration change,We can run the majority of config changes independantly of our code release.  All changes are auditable and revertable,We have to manual changes,,1
2,Observability,Feature Toggles Observability,How do we know which feature toggles are active for a deployment,We have a simple UI or API to see what's on in which environment,We track things manually on paper or in our heads,,1
3,Observability,Full stack Observability,Do you have multiple views of the entire stack's telemetry,We can see through the entire stack from the metal all the way up to the UI issues and performance,We can only see one or two layers and don't really tie them together to tell a story,,1
4,Observability,Hardware insights,How much insight do we have into the behaviour of our infra/deployment fabric,"We can tell you the CPU, RAM, Network & DiskIO for all our hardware in granular detail.  We can enumerate our hardware in detail and know which OS/CPU etc weâ€™re running on",We only have very rough measures of our hardware performance,,1
5,Testability,Feature Coverage,What proportion of the features are covered by a test,Every one of our features has at least one test,Less than 25% of our features have corresponding tests,,1
6,CI/CD,CI/CD Speed and Stability,CI/CD processes are fast and stable,The CI/CD pipelines are super fast and we get feedback on our software on almost real-time basis,CI/CD takes so long to do or is very fragile and we end up losing whole chunks of our day to it.,,1
7,Availability,MTTR,How long does it take you to restore service in the case of an incident,We track our MTTR across the board and can restore in <10 mins on average,We do not track this properly,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_time_to_repair,1
8,Culture,Easy to Release,How easy is it to release the software that you work to production,It's easy and straightforward to release my changes,It's very difficult to release and takes a long time,,2
9,Culture,Low friction processes,Do you feel that the processes are suitable for you to deliver software cotinuously,"The whole thing is a well oiled machine, everybody is in their groove and we barely feel any friction. The processes help us to do the right thing","The processes are painful, too numerous and makes us cry",,1
10,Culture,Psychological Safety,How safe do you feel to raise concerns,Our concerns are valued and used to help improve the team and org,If we riase concerns we are ignored or could get in trouble,,1
