1,dev-practices,Dev Practices,Config deployment,How easy is to deploy/inject a configuration change,We can run the majority of config changes independently of our code release.  All changes are auditable and revertable,We have to manual changes,,1
2,dev-practices,Dev Practices,Feature Coverage,What proportion of the features are covered by a test,Every one of our features has at least one test,Less than 25% of our features have corresponding tests,,1
3,dev-practices,Dev Practices,Unplanned Work,How much unplanned work do you have and how do you handle it,We have very little unplanned work and have spare capacity to handle any that comes in,More than half our work in any given sprint is unplanned,,1
4,dev-practices,Dev Practices,Broken Builds,Don't Check In on Broken Build except to fix the broken build,,,,1
5,dev-practices,Dev Practices,Stop the Line,"If any part of the pipeline fails, everyone stops feature work and fixes the problem",,,,1
6,dev-practices,Dev Practices,Idempotenent Deployment,We can deploy the same version repeatedly with the same result,We can redeploy the same version many times with the same result,It is difficult to get repeatable deployments,,1

2,observability,Observability,Feature Toggles Observability,How do we know which feature toggles are active for a deployment,We have a simple UI or API to see what's on in which environment,We track things manually on paper or in our heads,,1
3,observability,Observability,Full stack Observability,Do you have multiple views of the entire stack's telemetry,We can see through the entire stack from the metal all the way up to the UI issues and performance,We can only see one or two layers and don't really tie them together to tell a story,,1
4,observability,Observability,Hardware insights,How much insight do we have into the behaviour of our infra/deployment fabric,"We can tell you the CPU, RAM, Network & DiskIO for all our hardware in granular detail.  We can enumerate our hardware in detail and know which OS/CPU etc weâ€™re running on",We only have very rough measures of our hardware performance,,1
,,,,,,,,
6,ci-cd,CI/CD,CI/CD Speed and Stability,CI/CD processes are fast and stable,The CI/CD pipelines are super fast and we get feedback on our software on almost real-time basis,CI/CD takes so long to do or is very fragile and we end up losing whole chunks of our day to it.,,1
7,ci-cd,CI/CD,Blue-Green,Any mechanism to test a new version alongside an existing version when necessary,"We use fine-grained blue-green deployment techniques, at the level of individual services",We do not use any blue-green deployment techniques,,1
,,,,,,,,
7,availability,Availability,MTTR,How long does it take you to restore service in the case of an incident,We track our MTTR across the board and can restore in <10 mins on average,We do not track this properly,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_time_to_repair,1
,,,,,,,,
1,culture,Culture,Easy to Release,How easy is it to release the software that you work to production,It's easy and straightforward to release my changes,It's very difficult to release and takes a long time,,2
2,culture,Culture,Low friction processes,Do you feel that the processes are suitable for you to deliver software cotinuously,"The whole thing is a well oiled machine, everybody is in their groove and we barely feel any friction. The processes help us to do the right thing","The processes are painful, too numerous and makes us cry",,1
3,culture,Culture,Psychological Safety,How safe do you feel to raise concerns,Our concerns are valued and used to help improve the team and org,If we riase concerns we are ignored or could get in trouble,,1
4,culture,Culture,Teams around us,How well do the teams around you work with you and your team?,"Teams around us are very friendly and helpful, it's a joy to work with the other teams",Teams around us are unhelpful and rude,,1
5,culture,Culture,Management style,How effective and appropriate are the approaches by management and other senior stakeholders,The management approaches help us to deliver rapidly and safely,,,1
6,culture,Culture,Value,Do you work on valuable things as a team?,We live and breathe a value-driven team approach,We are disconnected from customer or user value,,1
7,culture,Culture,Mission,How well do you know why you are working on things?,We have a clear mission that we are with all stakeholders,It is rarely clear what our mission is,,1
8,culture,Culture,Speed,How rapidly do you work as a team?,We deliver work rapidly together,We seem to take a long time to get things done,,1
9,culture,Culture,Fun,How fun is it to work in your team? How much comraderie and sense of teamwork?,The team is a fun place to be every day,Fun is rarely an aspect of our team work,,1
10,culture,Culture,Learning,How much do you learn as a team?,We learn something every day,We rarely learn something new,,1
11,culture,Culture,Support,How much support do you get as a team?,We are well-supported as a team,We get very little support as a team,,1
12,culture,Culture,Pawns or players,How much control do you have our what you work on and how?,We have strong influence over what we work on,We have very little say in what we work on,,1
,,,,,,,,
1,tech,Tech,Tech quality,How healthy is the code base?,"Our code base is clean, safe to use and well-tested",Out code base is piled with workarounds and danger areas,,1
2,tech,Tech,Delivery Platform,How effective and easy to use is the delivery platform underpinning your team's delivery?,The platform is a force multiplier and helps us deliver rapidly and safely. We love the platform.,The platform seems to obstruct us and is difficult to use,,1
3,tech,Tech,API Replay,Record interactions against a service or API,We record key requests and responses from remote APIS which we use to build high-fidelity integratioon tests,We have no way to record requests or responses from a remote API,,1
4,tech,Tech,Binaries,Only Build Your Binaries Once. No special 'release candidate' builds,,,,1
5,tech,Tech,Stubs,Simulate external systems. Treat almost every other system as 'externa',The stubs we consume and write are good quality and give us a degree of confidence that our tests are working well.,There are few stubs available and we do noot have enough time to write stubs ourselves.,,1
